# Setup

Download this:

- https://code.visualstudio.com/
- https://nodejs.org/en/
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Open command prompt and head to your documents using `cd` ie. "C:\Users\Andrew\Documents"

`mkdir git`

`cd git`

`git clone https://github.uc.edu/severswa/BearCatPantryProject.git`

`cd BearCatPantryProject`

`code .`

This will open Visual Studio Code. I then save the project in /BearCatPantryProject as bearcat.code-workspace. In the future you can run `code bearcat.code-workspace` to pick up right where you left off.

Next, install all of the recommended extensions. Select the extension button the left-side wall and install everything.

Open the terminal in VSC using ctrl+alt+T and run

`npm install` - If this fails, restart your computer

First, you must build up the webpack bundles with `npm run build`

To get to the website run use `npm start`
and go to `http://localhost:3000`

When you make code changes, you must rerun `npm run build`, and then restart your server
