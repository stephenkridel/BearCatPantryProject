# Setup

Download this:
- https://code.visualstudio.com/
- https://nodejs.org/en/
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Open command prompt and head to your documents using `cd ` ie. "C:\Users\Andrew\Documents"

`mkdir git`

`cd git`

`git clone https://github.uc.edu/severswa/BearCatPantryProject.git` 

`cd BearCatPantryProject`

`code . `

This will open Visual Studio Code. I then save the project in /BearCatPantryProject as bearcat.code-workspace. In the future you can run `code bearcat.code-workspace` to pick up right where you left off.

Next, install all of the recommended extensions. Select the extension button the left-side wall and install everything.

Open the terminal in VSC using ctrl+alt+T and run  

`npm install` - If this fails, restart your computer

To get to the website run use `npm start` 
and go to `http://localhost:3000`

When you make code changes, all you have to do is refresh the page to see your changes.

You won't be able to add/view the database until your IP is whitelisted. I guess for security reasons cuz it's the free version.
