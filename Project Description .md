##### Project Description:
The Bearcat Pantry is looking to create an app and associated website to function as a 'virtual pantry' for University of Cincinnati Students that are unable to afford food. 
##### Project Problem Statement:
Currently, the Bearcat Pantry manually keeps track of Students and Inventory. As a result, Students using this service must call in to learn about the inventory of the food pantry. There is a need for a system that catalogs and updates inventory of the food pantry, which can also display the inventory on a website. 
##### Inadequacy of current solutions to problem:
The pantry currently does not track inventory in any aspect. The current system has an advisor unlock the pantry in French Hall, and the Student takes whatever they want. This is a bad system because it is not anonymous, and can be abused because inventory is not tracked.
##### Background skills/interests applicable to problem:
Web Development, Database Design, Android Development, Algorithm Development, Networking, Scripting, User Interface/User Experience. 
##### Team approach to problem:
Android App, with associated Server to host database, and Website.
