An example of this could be a project with a website element, requiring the usage of modern javascript libraries and web platforms to create. It could also be a project while requires cutting edge technologies like machine learning or image recognition or augmented reality. The gist of it, I want to work on a project that'll challenge what I know and require me to expand my knowledge to new places.
